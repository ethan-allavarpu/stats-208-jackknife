Analysis of Predictive inference with jackknife+ (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02928)

COFI data (trial extension) downloaded from https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/. Note that we use salinity as our response variable. Additionally, the downloaded CSV files (for the bottle and cast data) should go in `data/raw/CalCOFI_Database_194903-202001_csv_22Sep2021/` to work with our written scripts.
